# JS ES6 Drum Kit - Rhodes Polaris and Looperman drum loops

**Tech Used:** HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript

**Audio Sources:** http://machines.hyperreal.org/   and  https://www.looperman.com/

This is a drum machine built by using the tutorial from Wes Bos' JavaScript course.

I modified the original drum machine code (that was explained in the tutorial), to include all of the alphabet keys adding additional noises from synth machines and drum loops.


TO DO:
- update css to include responsive design
- add ability to loop certain sounds on keypress
- add ability to record
